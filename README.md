# Linear Data Structures and Problem Solving

This repository contains implementations of linear data structures such as arrays, linked lists, queues, and stacks, along with solutions to various problems related to them.

## Implementations

The following linear data structures have been implemented in this project:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Queues
- Stacks

Each implementation has its own directory and contains source code and relevant documentation.

## Problems

The following problems have been solved in this project:

### Combine Nodes Between Zeros

Given a linked list containing nodes with integer values, combine all nodes between any two consecutive zeros.

### Merge K Sorted Linked Lists

Given K sorted linked lists, merge them into a single sorted linked list.

### Convert Infix Expression to Postfix Expression

Convert an infix expression to postfix expression using stacks.

### Longest Valid Parentheses

Given a string containing parentheses, find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

### Generate Binary Numbers from 1 to n

Generate all binary numbers from 1 to n using a queue.

### Implement a Stack

Implement a stack using an array or linked list.

### Sorting a Queue

Sort a given queue using another queue.

## Usage

To use any of the implementations or solutions, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the relevant directory. Follow the instructions provided in the documentation to build and run the code.
